/**
 * <p>
 *   Implementation of the Spring WebFlux {@link ViewResolver}
 *   interface.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *   View resolvers execute after the controller ends its execution. They receive the name
 *   of the view to be processed and are in charge of creating (and configuring) the
 *   corresponding {@link View} object for it.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *   The {@link View} implementations managed by this class are of type {@link ThymeleafReactiveView}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *   In Spring WebFlux applications, Thymeleaf has three modes of operation depending on whether a limit
 *   has been set for the output chunk size and/or data-driver context variables have been specified:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><em>FULL</em>, when no limit for max chunk size is established ({@link #setResponseMaxChunkSizeBytes(int)})
 *       and no data-driver context variable has been specified. All template output will be generated in memory
 *       as a single chunk (a single {@link org.springframework.core.io.buffer.DataBuffer} object)
 *       and then sent to the server's output channels. In this mode, the Thymeleaf template engine
 *       works <em>unthrottled</em>, which may benefit performance in some scenarios with small templates,
 *       at the cost of a higher memory consumption.</li>
 *   <li><em>CHUNKED</em>, when a limit for max chunk size is established ({@link #setResponseMaxChunkSizeBytes(int)})
 *       but no data-driver context variable has been specified. Template output will be generated in chunks of a
 *       size equal or less than the specified limit (in bytes) and then sent to the server's output channels.
 *       After each chunk is emitted, the template engine will stop (thanks to its <em>throttling</em> mechanism), and
 *       wait for the server to request more chunks by means of reactive <em>backpressure</em>. Note
 *       this mechanism works single-threaded. When using this execution mode, the response will be configured
 *       by this {@link ViewResolver} so that each output chunk emitted provokes a <b>flush</b> operation at the
 *       server output channels (so that partial content is sent to the browser/client).</li>
 *   <li><em>DATA-DRIVEN</em>, when a <em>data-driver</em> variable has been specified at the context
 *       (by implementing {@link IReactiveDataDriverContextVariable}). This
 *       variable is expected to contain a <em>data stream</em> (usually in the shape of a
 *       {@link org.reactivestreams.Publisher} that Thymeleaf will consume, creating markup output as data
 *       is streamed from this <em>data-driver</em> and letting the output channels throttle
 *       template engine execution by means of back-pressure. When working in this mode, the response will be
 *       configured by this {@link ViewResolver} so that the server output channels are flushed after each
 *       engine execution (which will happen for each <em>buffer</em> (of configurable size) of elements
 *       collected from the <em>data-driver</em> stream. Additionally, if a value has been set for this
 *       {@code responseMaxChunkSizeBytes} property, the emitted
 *       {@link org.springframework.core.io.buffer.DataBuffer} output chunks will never exceed this size,
 *       and therefore more than one chunk could be emitted for each buffer of <em>data-driver</em> elements.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 *   Also note that the properties set by means of {@link #setFullModeViewNames(String[])} and
 *   {@link #setChunkedModeViewNames(String[])} also influence and fine-tune which templates are
 *   executed in {@code FULL} or {@code CHUNKED} mode (they have no effect on {@code DATA-DRIVEN}).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *   Also note that {@link ThymeleafReactiveView} objects can be specifically configured to be executed in
 *   {@code CHUNKED} mode by instantiating prototypes of them for the desired view names and setting a
 *   per-view max chunk size by means of {@link ThymeleafReactiveView#setResponseMaxChunkSizeBytes(int)}. If this
 *   is set to {@link Integer#MAX_VALUE}, they will be effectively configured to execute in {@code FULL} mode. This
 *   per-view setting will always have higher precedence than the one performed at the {@link ViewResolver} level.

     *   to the server as output.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     *   In Spring WebFlux applications, Thymeleaf has three modes of operation depending on whether a limit
     *   has been set for the output chunk size and/or data-driver context variables have been specified:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     *   <li><em>FULL</em>, when no limit for max chunk size is established and no data-driver context variable
     *       has been specified. All template output will be generated in memory as a single chunk
     *       (a single {@link org.springframework.core.io.buffer.DataBuffer} object)
     *       and then sent to the server's output channels. In this mode, the Thymeleaf template engine
     *       works <em>unthrottled</em>, which may benefit performance in some scenarios with small templates,
     *       at the cost of a higher memory consumption.</li>
     *   <li><em>CHUNKED</em>, when a limit for max chunk size is established but no data-driver context
     *       variable has been specified. Template output will be generated in chunks of a size equal or less
     *       than the specified limit (in bytes) and then sent to the server's output channels. After each chunk
     *       is emitted, the template engine will stop (thanks to its <em>throttling</em> mechanism), and
     *       wait for the server to request more chunks by means of reactive <em>backpressure</em>. Note
     *       this mechanism works single-threaded. When using this execution mode, the response will be configured
     *       by this {@link ViewResolver} so that each output chunk emitted provokes a <b>flush</b> operation at the
     *       server output channels (so that partial content is sent to the browser/client).</li>
     *   <li><em>DATA-DRIVEN</em>, when a <em>data-driver</em> variable has been specified at the context
     *       (implementing {@link IReactiveDataDriverContextVariable}). This
     *       variable is expected to contain a <em>data stream</em> (usually in the shape of a
     *       {@link org.reactivestreams.Publisher} that Thymeleaf will consume, creating markup output as data
     *       is streamed from this <em>data-driver</em> and letting the output channels throttle
     *       template engine execution by means of back-pressure. When working in this mode, the response will be
     *       configured by this {@link ViewResolver} so that the server output channels are flushed after each
     *       engine execution (which will happen for each <em>buffer</em> (of configurable size) of elements
     *       collected from the <em>data-driver</em> stream. Additionally, if a value has been set for this
     *       {@code responseMaxChunkSizeBytes} property, the emitted
     *       {@link org.springframework.core.io.buffer.DataBuffer} output chunks will never exceed this size,
     *       and therefore more than one chunk could be emitted for each buffer of <em>data-driver</em> elements.</li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     *   Also note that the properties set by means of {@link #setFullModeViewNames(String[])} and
     *   {@link #setChunkedModeViewNames(String[])} also influence and fine-tune which templates are
